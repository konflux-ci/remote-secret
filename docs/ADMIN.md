## Token Storage
### Vault

Vault is default token storage. Vault instance is deployed together with SPI components. `make deploy_minikube` or `make deploy_openshift` configures it automatically.
For other deployments, like [infra-deployments](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/infra-deployments) run `./hack/vault-init.sh` manually.

There are a couple of support scripts to work with Vault
- `./hack/vault-init.sh` - Initialize and configure Vault instance.
  - To change path prefix for the SPI data (default is `spi`), set `SPI_DATA_PATH_PREFIX` environment variable. Value must be without leading and trailing slashes (e.g.: `SPI_DATA_PATH_PREFIX=all/spi/tokens/here`). To configure Vault path prefix in SPI see `--vault-data-path-prefix` SPI property.
- `./hack/vault-generate-template.sh` - generates deployment yamls from [vault-helm](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm). These should be commited in this repository.
- injected in vault pod `/vault/userconfig/scripts/poststart.sh` - unseal vault storage. Runs automatically after pod startup.
- injected in vault pod `/vault/userconfig/scripts/root.sh` - vault login as root with generated root token. Can be used for manual configuration.

### AWS Secrets Manager

_Warning: AWS Secrets Manager as token storage is currently in experimental phase of implementation. Usage is not recommended for production use, implementation can change with backward breaking changes anytime without any further notice._

To enable AWS Secrets Manager as token storage, set `--tokenstorage=aws`. `make deploy_minikube_aws` or `make deploy_openshift_aws` configures it automatically.

SPI require 2 AWS configuration files, `config` and `credentials`. These can be set with `--aws-config-filepath` and `--aws-credentials-filepath`.

_Note: If you've used AWS cli locally, AWS configuration files should be at `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials`. To create the secret, use `./hack/aws-create-credentials-secret.sh`_

## [Service Level Objectives monitoring](#service-level-objectives-monitoring)

 There is a defined list of Service Level Objectives (SLO-s), for which RemoteSecret operator should collect indicator metrics, 
 and expose them on its monitoring framework.
